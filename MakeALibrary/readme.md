## Project Description

Libraries let you build functions that you and others can use to help build more powerful apps in lots of situations. As the designer of a library, you not only need to know how to program, but you also need to think about the many different kinds of programs other people might build.

For this project, you will design and build a library of functions around any topic you want. You will have an opportunity to exchange feedback with another group about how you might use their library to design an app. Finally, you will answer a few questions about the library you designed.

## You Will Submit

- A link to your library of functions
- This completed project guide

---

## Library Requirements

Your library must contain **two or more functions**, and at least one function must include:

- A loop
- An if-statement
- One or more parameters
- A return value

---

## Step 1 - Brainstorm

Your library can be about any topic. If you need some ideas, try the list below:

### Strings

- **Capitalize:** Capitalize the first letter of each word in a sentence (long string)
- **Trim:** Remove spaces from the beginning and end of a string
- **Remove Letter:** Remove a given letter from a string
- **Anything else you’d want to do with a string**

### Lists

- **Maximum:** Find the maximum value in a list
- **Minimum:** Find the minimum value in a list
- **Average:** Find the average value in a list
- **Count:** Count how many times a given value appears in a list
- **Combine:** Join two lists together into one longer, larger list
- **Filter Numbers:** Keep numbers in a list greater than or less than a provided value
- **Filter Letters:** Keep strings in a list that begin with a given letter
- **Numbered List:** Turn a list into a string with each item numbered and appearing on a different line
- **Top 3:** Return the three biggest numbers in a list, in sorted order (This can be a little tricky)
- **Unique:** Return a list of each unique item that appears in a list (This can be a little tricky)
- **Sort:** Return the list in sorted order (This can be a little tricky)
- **Anything else you’d want to do with a list**

### Dataset

- Choose a dataset and build a function that will help a user access or summarize specific information within that dataset.
